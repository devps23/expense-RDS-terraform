availability and durability: single
credential settings: username and password
DB instance class: db.t3.micro
storage type/storage : gp3
allocated storage:20
vpc
db subnet group
public access:no

* Endpoint and port in rds: means it is a dns name to connect backend server to rds server.
* telnet "endpoint and port" if it's not connecting means there is a security problem.
* sometimes if there is a default security for vpc we need to modify in rds
* at the same way instance side , check security group , in ingress if there is a default security change " all traffic and port" with cidr_block 0.0.0.0/0 then it allow any id address.

DataBackup:(solved: Adding backup parameters in RDS is solving it.)
===========
Like Database are important we need backup on those

Data Security: (Solved: by adding KMS keys to storage and encrypted it
==============
we are hosting our data in AWS. Meaning AWS can read our data??(here in RDS, mysql can read data from database and to encrypt the disk by using KMS key id)

Site Disaster:
==============
Due to any natural calamities our Data center can go down, how are design our application on availability

Disk encryption:
================
on top of the physical machine,there are multi VM's are available,in this VM's we can run OS(for example instance is an VM , OS is a red hat linux),to run software
at the same way in RDS also but there is a slight difference instead of running software,we can run Mysql
here there is a risk to access our data by someone, so here need to do disk encryption.

Disk Encryption:
================
Different type of storages:
-----------------------------
DAS ---- Direct attach storage
NAS ---- Network attach storage
in the above two storage , any one can provide Disk encryption,
KMS ---key Management system

Data Encryption:
=================
1. Data at REST(KMS Keys)
2.Data at Transmit(SSL/HTTPS)

once an instance is destroyed and recreating , at this time null resources wont be executed.
for this we can use
trigger{
instance = aws_instance.instance.id
}
this trigger will work only for null resources.


* to encrypt instance server disk also
root_block_device{
encrypted  = true
kms_key_id = kms_key_id
}

two types of backups:
=====================
* native backup
* mysql backup

// to take backup in rds we use snapshot
backup_retention_period = 35 , here 35 is number of days
backup_window = 09:46-10:16

What is VM goes down?/single server for each component
========================================================
Autoscaling group:
------------------
An Auto Scaling group in AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a collection of EC2 instances that are managed together as a single unit for automatic scaling and management.
Example Scenario:
==================
* Suppose you have a web application with fluctuating traffic:
* During peak hours, the Auto Scaling group can automatically launch additional instances to handle increased traffic.
* During off-peak hours, it can terminate instances to save costs.
* If an instance fails, it can automatically replace it with a new one.


* before creating autoscaling group
* first go to "launch template"

* install stress package to test cpu usage
stress --cpu 8 --timeout 200000s
